	/**
	 * TestResult is a class used to collect unit test results. The
	 * information collected includes a count of tests run and any failures
	 * or errors produced. Failures and errors are represented as instances
	 * of TestFailure.
	 * 
	 * A TestResult runs a Test by calling its runBare( ) method. A set of
	 * unit tests is run by creating an empty TestResult and calling
	 * run(TestResult) on each Test, passing the TestResult as a collecting
	 * parameter. At the end, the set of results is retrieved from the
	 * TestResult and reported. A TestResult also is created when the method
	 * Test.run() is used to execute a Test.
